
## Motivation
The main motivation behind this simple shiny app is to make it easier to locate blood banks, food banks, recycling banks and clothes banks in the Kuala Lumpur along with the associated addresses, contact number, email, coordinate and websites for blood banks. 

## Data:
Data for the banks is sourced from [Open Government Data Platform](https://data.gov.in/) and from Google searching. The original data is available as a csv file called "WIA1007 Data". The processed data file and our shiny code is made available on our github.

We have tried our best to comment and explain where necessary.

## Data limitation
One of the limitations of this application is that the data is hard to find. For example, statistics for recycling banks like amount and type of materials recycled is hardly documented online for it to be scraped.


## Help:
In case you observe the data projected on map is incorrect and you have more accurate or additional information that could be updated it will be great if you can email me and i will update the same.
